# Multilayer-Perception-MLP-Neural-Network-Implementation-In-FPGA
A final semester based group project for EE4218: Embedded Hardware System Design module in NUS where I worked with my teammate to perform Machine Learning models i.e. MLP Neural Networks on an FPGA using C, C++, Hardware Description Languages (HDL), High Level Synthesis (HLS) and Verilog.
